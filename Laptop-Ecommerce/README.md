## Redux Toolkit Integration

Redux Toolkit is integrated into the application for state management. It provides a convenient and efficient way to manage application state and actions, making it easier to handle complex state logic and updates across components.

## API Calling with Axios

Axios is used for making API calls in the application. It is a promise-based HTTP client that simplifies the process of sending asynchronous HTTP requests to the server.
